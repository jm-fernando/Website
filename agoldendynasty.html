        <h1>A Golden Dynasty</h1>
        <h2>by Jerome Fernando</h2>
        <p>
          The Golden State Warriors have been around since the NBA's inception. After winning championships in 1947, 1956 and 1975, the team hadn't found much success since. But the team's lucked turned for the better during the 2014 - 2015 NBA Season, when the Warriors would shock the basketball world by winning their first title in 40 years. This season spearheaded a dominant 4 year stretch -- winning two more titles in the process, in what many would consider one, if not THE greatest dynasties in basketball's history. We will take a deep dive into this momentous run, find out just how good they really are, and how they match up against established dynasties of years past.

            After having been a lottery team for many years, the Warriors' luck seem to have turned around. In 2010, Joe Lacob and Peter Guber bought the organization for $450 million, signifying a change within the organization. The following year, Mark Jackson was annouced as the new head coach. Since taking over the helm, the team has seen significant improvement, making the playoffs in Jackson's 2nd and 3rd year as head coach.

            But then, in a shocking turn of events, especially with the team's drastic improvement, the Warriors' brass decided to oust Mark Jackson and replace him with Steve Kerr. Change was felt instantly as the team's performance skyrocketed. With Kerr now at the help, the team was able to capture 2 championships in his first 3 years with the team.

            The other main component of the team's success? The core three. Lead by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, the team was a force to be reckoned with. Through changes in the supporting casts and at one point even adding another bonafide superstar in Kevin Durant, these three remained constant as the core that drove the Warriors to heights no one even dared to imagine years ago.

          Wardell Stephen Curry II, hailed as the greatest shooter in the history of the game. He holds the NBA record for most career three pointers made. Curry revolutionized (or in other people's opinions "ruined") the way basketball is played. Together, he and Klay Thompson form the "Splash Brothers", revered by many as the greatest shooting duo in history. He can shoot lights out from anywhere, has handles that can get you lost in outer space, and has a flair to his game that no other player can match.

          Klay Alexander Thompson, the other half of the Splash Brothers, also regarded as one of the greatest shooters in history. Don't let the laid back personality fool you, because he is a cerified bucket. Once he gets hot, it's hard to stop him. He holds the NBA record for most points in a single quarter with 37! Thompson can also hold it down on the defensive end of the floor, being revered as one of the best two-way players the game has today.

          Draymond Jamal Green Sr. The heart and soul of the team, the definition of a warrior. He is the team's vocal leader, not afraid to speak his mind on just about anything. With an insane level of basketball IQ, Green backs that talk up with defense so disruptive, your best player is almost guaranteed to have an off night when he's being defended by him. On offense he is the team's facilitator, in charge of getting the Splash Brothers, and everyone else going.
